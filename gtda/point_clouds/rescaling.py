class ConsistentRescaling(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin):
    """Rescaling of distances between pairs of points by the geometric mean
    of the distances to the respective :math:`k`-th nearest neighbours.

    Based on ideas in [1]_. The computation during :meth:`transform` depends on
    the nature of the array `X`. If each entry in `X` along axis 0 represents a
    distance matrix :math:`D`, then the corresponding entry in the transformed
    array is the distance matrix
    :math:`D'_{i,j} = D_{i,j}/\\sqrt{D_{i,k_i}D_{j,k_j}}`, where :math:`k_i` is
    the index of the :math:`k`-th largest value in row :math:`i` (and similarly
    for :math:`j`). If the entries in `X` represent point clouds, their
    distance matrices are first computed, and then rescaled according to the
    same formula.

    Parameters
    ----------
    metric : string or callable, optional, default: ``'euclidean'``
        If set to ``'precomputed'``, each entry in `X` along axis 0 is
        interpreted to be a distance matrix. Otherwise, entries are
        interpreted as feature arrays, and `metric` determines a rule with
        which to calculate distances between pairs of instances (i.e. rows)
        in these arrays.
        If `metric` is a string, it must be one of the options allowed by
        :func:`scipy.spatial.distance.pdist` for its metric parameter, or a
        metric listed in :obj:`sklearn.pairwise.PAIRWISE_DISTANCE_FUNCTIONS`,
        including "euclidean", "manhattan" or "cosine".
        If `metric` is a callable function, it is called on each pair of
        instances and the resulting value recorded. The callable should take
        two arrays from the entry in `X` as input, and return a value
        indicating the distance between them.

    metric_params : dict or None, optional, default: ``None``
        Additional keyword arguments for the metric function.

    neighbor_rank : int, optional, default: ``1``
        Rank of the neighbors used to modify the metric structure according
        to the "consistent rescaling" procedure.

    n_jobs : int or None, optional, default: ``None``
        The number of jobs to use for the computation. ``None`` means 1
        unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context. ``-1`` means
        using all processors.

    Attributes
    ----------
    effective_metric_params_ : dict
        Dictionary containing all information present in `metric_params`.
        If `metric_params` is ``None``, it is set to the empty dictionary.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from gtda.homology import ConsistentRescaling
    >>> X = np.array([[[0, 0], [1, 2], [5, 6]]])
    >>> cr = ConsistentRescaling()
    >>> X_rescaled = cr.fit_transform(X)
    >>> print(X_rescaled.shape)
