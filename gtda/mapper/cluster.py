class ParallelClustering(BaseEstimator):
    """Employ joblib parallelism to cluster different portions of a dataset.

    An arbitrary clustering class which stores a ``labels_`` attribute in
    ``fit`` can be passed to the constructor. Examples are most classes in
    ``sklearn.cluster``. The input of :meth:`fit` is of the form ``[X_tot,
    masks]`` where ``X_tot`` is the full dataset, and ``masks`` is a
    two-dimensional boolean array, each column of which indicates the
    location of a portion of ``X_tot`` to cluster separately. Parallelism is
    achieved over the columns of ``masks``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    clusterer : object, optional, default: ``None``
        Clustering object such as derived from
        :class:`sklearn.base.ClusterMixin`. ``None`` means that the default
        :class:`sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN` is used.

    n_jobs : int or None, optional, default: ``None``
        The number of jobs to use for the computation. ``None`` means 1
        unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context. ``-1`` means
        using all processors.

    parallel_backend_prefer : ``'processes'`` | ``'threads'``, optional, \
        default: ``'threads'``
        Selects the default joblib backend. The default process-based backend
        is 'loky' and the default thread-based backend is 'threading'.

    Attributes
    ----------
    clusterers_ : tuple of object
        If `clusterer` is not ``None``, clones of `clusterer` fitted
        to the portions of the full data array specified in :meth:`fit`.
        Otherwise, clones of a default instance of
        :class:`sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN`, fitted in the same way.

    clusters_ : list of list of tuple
       Labels and indices of each cluster found in :meth:`fit`. The i-th
       entry corresponds to the i-th portion of the data; it is a list
       of triples of the form ``(i, label, indices)``, where ``label`` is a
       cluster label and ``indices`` is the array of indices of points
       belonging to cluster ``(i, label)``.

class FirstSimpleGap(ClusterMixin, BaseEstimator, Agglomerative):
    """Agglomerative clustering cutting the dendrogram at the first instance
    of a sufficiently large gap.

    A simple threshold is determined as a fraction of the largest linkage
    value in the full dendrogram. If possible, the dendrogram is cut at the
    first occurrence of a gap, between the linkage values of successive merges,
    which exceeds this threshold. Otherwise, a single cluster is returned. The
    algorithm can be partially overridden to ensure that the final number of
    clusters does not exceed a certain threshold, by passing a parameter
    `max_fraction`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    relative_gap_size : float, optional, default: ``0.3``
        The fraction of the largest linkage in the dendrogram to be used as
        a threshold for determining a large enough gap.

    max_fraction : float or None, optional, default: ``None``
        When not ``None``, the algorithm is constrained to produce no more
        than ``max_fraction * (n_samples - 1)`` clusters, even if a
        candidate gap is observed in the iterative process which would produce
        a greater number of clusters.

    affinity : str, optional, default: ``'euclidean'``
        Metric used to compute the linkage. Can be ``'euclidean'``, ``'l1'``,
        ``'l2'``, ``'manhattan'``, ``'cosine'``, or ``'precomputed'``.
        If linkage is ``'ward'``, only ``'euclidean'`` is accepted.
        If ``'precomputed'``, a distance matrix (instead of a similarity
        matrix) is needed as input for :meth:`fit`.

    memory : None, str or object with the joblib.Memory interface, \
        optional, default: ``None``
        Used to cache the output of the computation of the tree.
        By default, no caching is done. If a string is given, it is the
        path to the caching directory.

    linkage : ``'ward'`` | ``'complete'`` | ``'average'`` | ``'single'``, \
        optional, default: ``'single'``
        Which linkage criterion to use. The linkage criterion determines which
        distance to use between sets of observation. The algorithm will merge
        the pairs of cluster that minimize this criterion.

        - ``'ward'`` minimizes the variance of the clusters being merged.
        - ``'average'`` uses the average of the distances of each observation
          of the two sets.
        - ``'complete'`` linkage uses the maximum distances between
          all observations of the two sets.
        - ``'single'`` uses the minimum of the distances between all
          observations of the two sets.

    Attributes
    ----------
    n_clusters_ : int
        The number of clusters found by the algorithm.

    labels_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)
        Cluster labels for each sample.

    children_ : ndarray of shape (n_nodes - 1, 2)
        The children of each non-leaf node. Values less than ``n_samples``
        correspond to leaves of the tree which are the original samples.
        A node ``i`` greater than or equal to ``n_samples`` is a non-leaf
        node and has children ``children_[i - n_samples]``. Alternatively
        at the ``i``-th iteration, ``children[i][0]`` and ``children[i][1]``
        are merged to form node ``n_samples + i``.

    n_leaves_ : int
        Number of leaves in the hierarchical tree.

    distances_ : ndarray of shape (n_nodes - 1,)

        optional, default: ``'single'``
        Which linkage criterion to use. The linkage criterion determines which
        distance to use between sets of observation. The algorithm will merge
        the pairs of cluster that minimize this criterion.

        - ``'ward'`` minimizes the variance of the clusters being merged.
        - ``'average'`` uses the average of the distances of each observation
          of the two sets.
        - ``'complete'`` linkage uses the maximum distances between
          all observations of the two sets.
        - ``'single'`` uses the minimum of the distances between all
          observations of the two sets.

    Attributes
    ----------
    n_clusters_ : int
        The number of clusters found by the algorithm.

    labels_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)
        Cluster labels for each sample.

    children_ : ndarray of shape (n_nodes - 1, 2)
        The children of each non-leaf node. Values less than ``n_samples``
        correspond to leaves of the tree which are the original samples.
        A node ``i`` greater than or equal to ``n_samples`` is a non-leaf
        node and has children ``children_[i - n_samples]``. Alternatively
        at the ``i``-th iteration, ``children[i][0]`` and ``children[i][1]``
        are merged to form node ``n_samples + i``.

    n_leaves_ : int
        Number of leaves in the hierarchical tree.

    distances_ : ndarray of shape (n_nodes - 1,)
        Distances between nodes in the corresponding place in
        :attr:`children_`.
